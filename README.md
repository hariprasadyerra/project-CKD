## Chronic Kidney Disease

This project focuses on building machine learning models to classify whether a patient has Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) or not, using three widely used algorithms: Naive Bayes, Kâ€‘Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and LightGBM. The repository provides a structured pipeline covering data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and results comparison, making it easy to reproduce experiments and extend the work further.
## Project Description
Chronic Kidney Disease is a significant global health issue, and early detection can drastically improve patient outcomes. Machine learning models can help identify high risk patients by analyzing clinical and laboratory data. This project leverages three algorithms with distinct strengths:
## Naive Bayes 
A simple probabilistic model that assumes feature independence. It is fast, interpretable, and useful as a baseline.
## K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 
A non parametric method that classifies based on similarity to neighboring data points. It is intuitive but sensitive to scaling and irrelevant features.
## LightGBM
A gradient boosting framework optimized for speed and efficiency, capable of capturing complex, non linear relationships. Often the strongest performer on structured/tabular data.
