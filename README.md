## Chronic Kidney Disease

This project focuses on building machine learning models to classify whether a patient has Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) or not, using three widely used algorithms: Naive Bayes, Kâ€‘Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and LightGBM. The repository provides a structured pipeline covering data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and results comparison, making it easy to reproduce experiments and extend the work further.
